# So I had some ideas for a script.
# They're kinda wild though so bear with me please.
# I had these ideas while I was working out and thinking about life lmao.

mc 'If we're all the main characters in our life...'
mc 'Then who dies for character development? How do we know how much we need?'
mc 'I don't seem to have parents, so they can't die.'
mc 'However, this isn't much of an issue. I'm just a proxy.'
mc 'Isn't that right, [username]?'
mc 'Don't be surprised, Monika did this too.'
mc 'I'm your proxy after all, so she was talking to me as well.'
mc 'What you should be worried about is how many people have to die.'
mc 'There are four girls, we can assume Monika remembers as she's president again.'
mc 'Meaning there are three possible sacrifices.'
mc 'How much character development do you need? One person? Two? All three?'
mc 'Or have you already developed? Will you be able to not kill anyone?'
mc 'I can't control you, so you'll have to choose. I just ask you don't get me in trouble.'
mc 'Is that alright, [username]?'
mc 'Please remember, the club leader is also a main character.

mc 'Please enjoy the game.'
'The festival is tomorrow, sleep is needed to be productive.'
mc 'Aha, you hear that [username]? The festival! Where everything changed!'
mc 'You know what happens now don't you? Poor poor Sayori, all alone with nothing but a rope as company.'
mc 'Soon, that rope? It will turn into a noose.'
mc 'Then the noose over the head..'
mc 'And GLERK, the suffocation.'
mc 'As Monika said, she failed the hanging. She didn't snap her neck.'
mc 'She'll sit there, choking, in horrible pain. Her hands will rip at the noose.'
mc 'But the more you struggle against the inevitable, the harder it comes.'
mc 'She sits there for minutes, suffocating. Eventually she passes out.'
mc 'And then what happens? She can't struggle, she went into that good night.'
mc 'What will you do? You don't have long, will you help her? Will you let her suffer?'

				'get up':
					mc 'Chop chop then! Get to it!'
					'Out of bed, luckily we've been friends so long I have her address memoried.
					'I bolt out the door, breathing ragged, I'm hyperaware of everything going on around me, the slap of my feet on the asphalt'
					'The breathing in my lungs is like fire, I hadn't prepared myself for sudden exertion.'
					'There it is, the door to her house.'
					'I slam it open, forgetting people could be sleeping.'
					'Upstairs, I need to get upstairs now. I'm not sure why but I feel like something is wrong.'
					mc 'Hehe, I know what's going on but I'm not this guy. Neither are you, so this is what it's like to have a proxy...'
					'I do not gently open the door, I slam it open.'
					'Sayori is there, noose in hand. She stops when she sees me, eyes wide.'
					'I must be a mess, I'm half asleep, my hair is a mess, but that's not importnat.'
					mc 'God, even had the time to think about that. I really was a dumbass.'
					'Sayori is looking at me, but the only thing I can see is the noose.'
					'Time slows down to a crawl as I rack my brain, my friend has a noose in her hand, about to kill herself. What do I do in this moment?'
					'Bed, chair, noose, dresser, bed chair noose dresser bedchairnoosedresser.'
					'I throw myself at Sayori, grabbing her by the shoulders and throwing her onto her bed.'
					'I hold her there, my heart beating rapidly as my senses come back.'
					'There's the noose, around her neck, I need to get rid of it.'
					'But wait, nooses become tighter the more you pull on them.'
					'I put my arm under the noose as I pull it off her, in case I pull on the string.'
					'I take the noose, putting it in my pocket.'
					mc 'What have I got in my pocket?' # Note to self, remove line before release. 
					'I sit down, watching Sayori as she slowly raises herself.'
					'With my hands already in my pockets, I decide to get rid of the noose.'
					'I pull on it, knowing that'll tighten it until it's no longer usable.'
					dense_mc 'So Sayori, talk to me.'
					mc 'We all know what happens here, boring talk scene. SKIP!'
					splash_screen_next_morning.png
					'I\'m awake, Sayori isn't.'
					'We must have passed out while talking last night.'
					'I can\'t see her waking up soon.'
					'She\'s woken up late for years.'
					'So, I decide now is a good time to raid her room.'
					mc 'What. I was horny but not *this* horny, do I need to be dragged out into the street and fucking shot?'
					'I start at her desk, opening it and shoving stuff aside.'
					'I know exactly what I\'m looking for.'
					mc 'This is going to be one of the things we both are up at three in the morning thinking about isn\'t it.'
					'I take out any sort of knife or blade I can, which is thankfully only scissors amd set them aside.'
					mc 'Won\'t she, need those for school? Cmon man. There is a SINGLE pair of scissors.'
					'I go downstairs into the kitchen, and start rummaging around.'
					mc 'Ah yes, take her kitchen knives too.'
					'I take out a pan and bowl, before moving to the fridge.'
					'Taking out eggs and milk, I move to the oven.'
					mc 'Oh I\'m even more scared now. I never cook.'
					'I don\'t cook often, so this could be a disaster.'
					'However, I plan on just using this an excuse to not leave her alone.'
					mc 'Smart I... Guess? The cooking will kill her before the noose does.'
					'Making eggs, or food in general, is not my strong point.'
					'...Now that I think about it.'
					'My strong points are really only watching anime aren\'t they?'
					mc 'So he figured it out I see.'
					'To be a better friend, maybe I should get some skills...'
					mc 'I wouldn\'t say that's how it works. But like, whatever.'
					mc 'At least it\'s progress.'
					＃くそ, it's hard to write. I prefer coding actual tools to this tbh. 
					# I need to keep a consistent theme here, make the characters believable.
					# Shit's hard man.
					'Cooking could be one, it will help me later anyway.'
					mc 'There we go, good reason.'
					'I should see if there are classes available.'
					'I should make Sayori join as well.'
					'Something tells me I won\'t be here to help her all the time.'
					'I really hope these are ready...'
					'I take the pan off the stove quickly, dishing them onto plates.'
					'Eggs, a normal breakfast. I need some hint of normalcy after last night however.'
					'I have slept on it and yet it still seems insane to me.'
					'I most likely need to simply accept it.'
					'If I elect not to I could end up hurting her.'
					mc 'Why does he figure that? This isn't an anime and this isn\'t real life, just a game.'
					mc 'Just a game...'
					'Onto the table it goes, as well as it\'s a school day, so I need to wake her up now.'
					'I walk upstairs, opening the door.'
					'Maybe I should knock now that I\'ve gotten rid of the noose..'
					'Ah well, I already opened the door.'
					dense_mc 'Sayori, good morning!'
					dence_mc 'Today is the festival!'
					mc 'It is?'
					'Sayori wakes up slowly, seemingly surprised to see me.'
					s 'You\'re still here?!'
					s 'Oh wait it\'s today? Lemme get up.'
					dense_mc 'I made breakfast, so just make sure to shower before coming downstairs.'
					'I leave the room, closing the door behind me,'
					'I should most likely shower as well, but everything I have is back home.'
					'I turn around, knocking on the door.'
					dense_mc 'I\'m going home to shower but I\'ll be right back.'
					'I head downstairs, leaving her house and heading back to mine.'
					dense_mc 'God I really hope nothing happens.'
					mc 'YOU FOOL! THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CLICHE THINGS, DON\'T RUIN IT ALL ALREADY!'
					'I head back inside, showering as fast as I can and heading back to Sayori\'s house.'
					mc 'I am speed.' # Also remove before release lmao.
					# Doing a truly branching mod is a pain in the ass.
					# Also how do you write documentation or notes for this? It's just dialogue.
					'I walk back into the house.'
					s 'How was your shower?'
					'Ah, there she is. Eating at the table.'
					dense_mc 'It was good, yours?'
					mc 'Oh great, normal conversation.'
					'We ate, making small talk. I wanted to bring up last night but I could not figure out how.'
					'It was time to head to school, I figured today was as good a day as any to walk there with her.'
					mc 'Congratulations, you have made it past the tutorial. There are other branches in this tutorial as well.'
					mc 'Not to worry, this path will still continue even after this. I do not believe in starting over without anything.'
					mc 'Now, onto the festival. Please enjoy.'
				'nah, let's not':
